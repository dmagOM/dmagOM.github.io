I'm a Sales Engineer and sometime software developer working in fin tech, currently with [Vela Trading Technologies][VelaTT]. Particularly interested in the [OpenMAMA project][OpenMAMA GitHub], compilers (mostly LLVM) and market data. Currently learning a bit of Haskell, and will probably get to the obligatory "Monands are like..." post any time now. This blog is mostly ramblings on development, architecture, languages and OpenMAMA. Expect updates to be infrequent, rambling and barely cognigent.

Technologies:
* C, C++, Java, Python, Haskell...
* OpenMAMA & MAMDA
* Make, CMake, Scons
* Clang and LLVM, GCC, GDB, LLDB
* Valgrind, ASAN, MSAN, TSAN
